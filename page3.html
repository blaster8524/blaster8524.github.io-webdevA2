      <h1><strong id = "textnode">Reception for Soulslike: Is it Fun? </strong></h1>
      <p> Interviews with developers of Soulslike games revealed that they all thought of being classified as part of the genre as a 
        positive thing that functioned as a useful description for players. However, some believed that it could be misleading, causing
        players to expect certain things and be disappointed when a game does not have them. An example of this was players being 
        disappointed that Remnant: From the Ashes was primarily a shooter, despite being characterized as a soulslike.

      <h2>Example 1, Demon's Souls </h2>
      <p> Upon its release in Japan, Demon's Souls was generally well received by critics. Dengeki scored the game 95/85/85/85, 
        adding up to 350 out of 400, saying that "fans of old-school games will shed tears of joy." Upon release in North America, 
        the game received critical acclaim with an average critic score of 89/100 at Metacritic. Despite the game's high difficulty, 
        many reviewers found it to be a positive aspect, making the game more rewarding to play. Releasing upon globally and locally,
        Demon's Souls set the bar for being soulslike with its high difficulty.</p>

    <div class="box">
      <h2>Example 2, Code Vein</h2>
      <p> Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu gave the game a good score of 32/40. The heart of Code Vein remains overburdened by stale 
        scenery, boring bosses, and tiresome trudging, and all of that is beyond what some nice touches can redeem." While GameSpot 
        stated, "Code Vein adopts the Souls-like formula in its structure, presenting a familiar cycle of progression and basic combat 
        similarities, and there are some interesting ideas here, too, built around the use of various Blood Codes and their distinct 
        Gifts." A different take of the Souls games, making it more anime inspired, receives mixed reviews due to lack of uniqueness
        it presents compared to other Soulslikes.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h2>Example 3, Mortal Shell </h2>
      <p> Mortal Shell was met by generally positive reviews on all platforms, according to the review aggregator Metacritic, and was 
        nominated for Best Debut Game at The Game Awards 2020. Reviewers frequently compared the game to playing Dark Souls for the 
        first time. GameSpot awarded the game an 8/10, saying: "Cold Symmetry's budget action-RPG is a love letter to From Software's 
        work, but Mortal Shell's take on similar ideas feels aimed at those who struggle to get through Soulsborne games."</p>

    <div class="box">
      <h2>Conclusion </h2>
      <p> Overall, Soulslike games depends on player's view on challenge and the willingness to undertake the process of fighting
        over and over again, learning new things when players add ingenuity and creativity in their gameplay while fighting the same
        boss the next time. If you are a person who does not like dying over and over again, getting frustrated over numerous deaths,
        then maybe a role-playing game might suit you more than Soulslike games.
