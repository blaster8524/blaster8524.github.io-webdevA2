      <h2>Runner up: Sekiro</h2>
      <p> Gameplay is focused on stealth, exploration, and combat, with a particular emphasis on boss battles. The game takes place in
         a fictionalized Japan during the Sengoku period and makes strong references to Buddhist mythology and philosophy. A
        different take of the Souls series formula FromSoftware uses, it gives a refreshing and different feel, with a different
        mechanic in defeating enemies, depleting enemies' posture rather than whittling their health away. Sekiro takes the Runner
         up with its unique shinobi feel and japanese aesthetics</p>

      <h2>2nd Runner up: Bloodborne </h2>

        whose inhabitants are afflicted with a blood-borne disease. Bloodborne was released in March 2015 and received critical acclaim,
        with praise directed at its gameplay, particularly its high difficulty level, atmosphere, sound design, Lovecraftian themes, 
        and interconnected world design. A classic that truly needs trying out in the Souls series.</p>
