      <h1><strong id = "textnode">Why the term Soulslike? </strong></h1>
      <p>The term Soulslike refers to games similar in terms of difficulty and aesthetics to Demon's Souls and its successor the Dark
        Souls series, in more general terms games that are inspired by the "Souls" series such as Demon's Souls developed by 
        FromSoftware.
      </p>

      <h2>Other nicknames </h2>
      <p>  Soulslike games developed by FromSoftware themselves are more specifically referred to as Soulsborne games, a portmanteau 
        of Souls and Bloodborne. Soulslikes have been adopted by a number of critics and developers. However there is debate on
        whether Soulslike is a true genre, or rather just a pool of shared mechanics in games itself. Of course, the name Soulslike
        is just a cultural label, so people would generalise such games into the category, and would continue calling such games
        either Soulslike or Soulsborne if made by FromSoftware.

      <h2>Gameplay of Soulslike Games </h2>
      <p> Soulslike games typically have a high level of difficulty where repeated player-character death is expected and incorporated 
        as part of the gameplay, losing all progress if certain checkpoints have not been reached. Soulslike games also usually have 
        means to permanently improve the player-character's abilities as to be able to progress further, often by a type of currency 
        that can be earned and spent, but may be lost or abandoned between deaths if not appropriately managed, similar to the souls 
        in the Souls series.</p>

    <div class="box">
      <h2>Setting and Plot </h2>
      <p> Soulslike games are commonly defined by their dark fantasy setting and lack of overt storytelling, as well as their deep 
        worldbuilding, with a captivating world being cited as key to spark players' desire to explore. Players are meant to 
        discover bits and pieces of the game's lore over time via environmental storytelling, item descriptions and cryptic dialogue, 
        piecing it together themselves to increase the game's sense of mystery.</p>
