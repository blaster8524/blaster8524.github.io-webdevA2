      <h1><strong id = "textnode"> Soulslike Games and their Origin </strong></h1>
      <p> The soulslike genre had its genesis in the 2009 video game Demon's Souls, developed by FromSoftware 
        and designed by Hidetaka Miyazaki. It introduced the core tenets that would be followed by later Souls games, and, 
        by extension, soulslikes as well. The subgenre was later popularized by the second Souls game, Dark Souls, in 2011.</p>

      <h2>The<strong id = "textnode"> Origin </strong> of Soulslike, Demon's Souls</h2>
      <p> So by explaining about Soulslike Games, we need to begin from it's first game. In this case Demon's Souls.
        Demon's Souls is an action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware for the PlayStation 3 under the supervision of 
        Japan Studio. It was published in Japan by Sony Computer Entertainment in February 2009, in North America by Atlus USA in 
        October 2009, and in PAL territories by Namco Bandai Partners in June 2010. The game's difficulty was intended to both evoke 
        classic video games and provide a sense of challenge and accomplishment for players.

      <h2>Traits of Demon's Souls </h2>
      <p> Demon's Souls takes place in the kingdom of Boletaria. "In ancient times, due to the misuse of magic known as the Soul Arts, 
        Boletaria was attacked by a being called the Old One. The world was nearly consumed by the magical "Deep Fog" and the 
        soul-eating demons it created. The Old One was eventually lulled to slumber, saving what remained of Boletaria, while some 
        survivors became long-lived Monumentals to warn future generations." From the synopsis itself, the game's theme is quite
        ominous albeit medieval, and from how its difficulty is quite high, makes the game a challenging game for
        players who want to challenge themselves.

      <h2>Demon's Souls' Successor, Dark Souls 3 </h2>
      <p> Now we can look into one of its famous successors, Dark Souls 3 and have a summary of it. "Set in the Kingdom of Lothric, a 
        bell has rung to signal that the First Flame, responsible for maintaining the Age of Fire, is dying out. As has happened many 
        times before, the coming of the Age of Dark produces the undead: cursed beings that rise after death." Once again,
        Dark Souls 3 has a similar "kingdom in ruins" theme, coupled with high intensity gameplay and difficulty from the bosses.
        This explains that the successors of Demon's Souls continue to have similar traits of Demon's Souls.</p>
